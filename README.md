Your goal in this exercise is to write a program that finds all the prime numbers in a given range of numbers.
We will build this program in steps, each step adding another function that use the previous one.

## What is a prime number?
Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1. They only have two factors (divisors): 1 and the number itself. This means these numbers cannot be divided by any number other than 1 and the number itself without leaving a remainder.
### Examples
5 is a prime number because its only factors are 1 and 5.
20 is not a prime number, as it has many divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10.
11 is a prime number, because itâ€™s divisible only by 1 and 11.
