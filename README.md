## Masterschool Codio Description

## Prime Minister

The goal in this exercise is to write a program that finds all the prime numbers in a given range of numbers.

```
5 is a prime number because its only factors are 1 and 5.
20 is not a prime number, as it has many divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10.
11 is a prime number, because itâ€™s divisible only by 1 and 11.
```

### Specification

The user should be prompted with a message to insert a start range number and an end range number, and the program prints all the prime numbers within that range, not including the end range number.

#### Example output
```
$ python3 prime.py
Enter start range: 10
Enter end range: 20
The number 11 is prime
The number 13 is prime
The number 17 is prime
The number 19 is prime
```
